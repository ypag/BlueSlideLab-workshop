# BlueSlideLab

The Blue Slide Laboratory engages young learners(4th- 8th grade) in educational and performative experiences at the playground by connecting physics and math principles to imaginative play and interaction 

The first of the series of these apps helps children learn periodic motions( physics of pendulum) with help fo playful interactions at swings in playground. 

Tracking strategy is based on CMT (Consensus-based Matching and Tracking of Keypoints for Object Tracking) by gnebehay (https://github.com/gnebehay/CppMT)
